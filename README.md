//Create a random background with the lyrics from "Puff"

I was inspired by our previous miniex with the RITA library since I thought that something was missing back then. So now I have created the missing pieces which are the buttons.

You can click on one of the many different buttons to create a random background with the lyrics from "Puff". 


//What are the advantages in using objects and what might be the limitations? What's your experience in using objects?

By using objects in your program you can shortening your code when it gets too long and create a nice structure to the coding.
By using CLASS you can group something in your coding which is more useful compared to when you have to use a function multiple times. 

I have not used it for my own program but when we tried it with the instructors it was very usefull. 


At first I wanted to create something with the dancing sliders from Daniel Shiffman's video but unfortunately I did not work for me so I got inspired to create something new from our previous miniex with the RITA library. 

I like using objects to create something more obvious and use it in the coding. It was also very inspiring to watch the Form Art Competition butvery complicated to create something like that myself.
